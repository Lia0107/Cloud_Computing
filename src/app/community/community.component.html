            <h4>City Hall</h4>
            <p>Located at the westernmost point of Penang Island, this majestic building is a funky formula of Neo-Baroque 
                and Palladian architectural styles, featuring colonnades, arched windows, and a sharp rooftop silhouette.</p>

            <h4>Kek Lok Si</h4>
            <p>Part of this temple is currently under construction, but if you don't mind a bit of scaffolding, then head on up to 
            Air Itam for the largest Buddhist temple in Malaysia. Cultural Buddhism makes itself transparent here — mythical dragons, 
            Chinese goddesses, and small Buddha figurines line the walls, ceilings and walkways in this complex of temples.</p>

            <h4>Unknown Café & Bistro @ Pahang Road, Georgetown, Penang</h4>
            <p>Unknown Cafe has a nice classy interior which is comfortable for a dine in. Most of the table here is small making it 
            suitable for small group of friends or family. I like how the interior look so white and modern.</p>
